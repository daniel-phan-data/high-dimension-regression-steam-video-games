# MODEL_LIN_STEAM

## Folder structure
We coded the same functions and scripts in R, python and SAS.
The files are as follows :

bivariate_tests: script that displays the bivariate tests used for our analysis

classification : script that creates and test a classification model that predicts estimated owners of a given game

correlation_matrix : script that displays the correlation matrix of the selected relevant variables for our analysis

lm_and_hypotheses: script that creates linear models and test the essential hypotheses

lm_selection : script that can run linear model selection algorithms

setup : used to load and clean our data before analysis

univ_rating : script to display statistical tests on the rating variable we created

univariate_tests : script that displays all the univariate tests we needed for the report

univariate_tests_log : more univariate tests with a log transformation for the variables hard to visualize otherwise

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
